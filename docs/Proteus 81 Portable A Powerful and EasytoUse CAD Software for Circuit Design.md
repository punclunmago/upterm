Proteus 8.1 Portable has many features and benefits that make it a great choice for electrical and electronics engineers, hobbyists, students and teachers. Some of these features and benefits are:
 
- It is portable, which means you can run it from a USB flash drive or any other removable media without installing it on your computer.
- It has a user-friendly interface that allows you to design and simulate circuits in a single screen.
- It has a large library of electronic components, including microcontrollers, microprocessors, DSPs and more, that you can use in your circuits.
- It has a powerful simulation engine that can co-simulate both high-level and low-level microcontroller code in the context of a mixed-mode SPICE circuit simulation.
- It has a variety of measurement tools, such as oscilloscope, signal generator, voltmeter, ammeter and more, that you can use to test and debug your circuits.
- It has a PCB layout module that allows you to design PCBs from your schematic with features such as shape-based autoroute, 3D visualization, net tuning, design snippets and assembly variants.
- It has a Visual Designer for Arduino module that allows you to create Arduino programs with simple flowcharting methods and place Arduino shields on your schematic with a mouse click.
- It has an IoT Builder module that allows you to create a user interface for your phone or tablet to interact with your Arduino electronics.

Proteus 8.1 Portable is available as a .rar file that you can download from various online sources[^3^] [^5^]. However, be aware that downloading software from untrusted sources may pose security risks to your computer and data. You should always scan the downloaded file with an antivirus program before opening it. Alternatively, you can purchase the official version of Proteus Professional 8.1 from the Proteus website[^1^] [^2^] or other authorized resellers.

In this article, we will show you how to use Proteus 8.1 Portable to design and simulate a simple LED blink circuit with an Arduino Uno board. You will need the following components:

- An Arduino Uno board
- A breadboard
- An LED
- A 220 ohm resistor
- Some jumper wires

Follow these steps to create the circuit:

1. Extract the Proteus 8.1 Portable .rar file to a folder on your removable media.
2. Run the Proteus.exe file from the folder.
3. Click on the New Project icon on the toolbar or go to File > New Project.
4. Enter a name for your project and choose a location to save it. Click Next.
5. Select ISIS Schematic Capture as the design type and click Next.
6. Select Arduino Uno as the target device and click Next.
7. Click Finish to create the project.
8. You will see a blank schematic with an Arduino Uno board on it. You can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or the toolbar buttons.
9. To add components to the schematic, click on the Pick Devices icon on the toolbar or press P on your keyboard.
10. A window with a list of components will appear. You can search for components by name or category.
11. Find and select an LED from the list and click OK.
12. Place the LED on the schematic by clicking on an empty spot. You can rotate the component by pressing R on your keyboard or right-clicking and choosing Rotate.
13. Repeat steps 9 to 11 to add a resistor and a breadboard to the schematic.
14. To connect components with wires, click on the Draw Wires icon on the toolbar or press W on your keyboard.
15. Click on a terminal of a component and drag to another terminal of another component. Release the mouse button to complete the wire.
16. Connect the components as shown in the figure below. Make sure to connect the LED's anode (longer leg) to the resistor and the cathode (shorter leg) to ground. Also, connect one end of the resistor to pin 13 of the Arduino board.

You have completed the circuit design. Now you need to write and upload the code for the Arduino board. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the Visual Designer icon on the toolbar or go to Tools > Visual Designer for Arduino.
2. A new window with a flowchart editor will appear. You can drag and drop blocks from the toolbox to create your program logic.
3. Create a flowchart as shown in the figure below. This program will turn on and off the LED every second.

5. Click on the Upload icon on the toolbar or press F8 on your keyboard to upload your program to the Arduino board. You will see a message saying "Upload Successful".

You have completed the code upload. Now you can simulate your circuit and see how it works. Follow these steps:

1. Close the Visual Designer window and return to the schematic window.
2. Click on the Play icon on the toolbar or press F5 on your keyboard to start the simulation. You will see a message saying "Simulation Running".
3. Observe how your LED blinks according to your program logic. You can also use measurement tools such as oscilloscope or voltmeter to analyze your circuit behavior.
4. To stop the simulation, click on the Stop icon on the toolbar or press F6 on your keyboard. You will see a message saying "Simulation Stopped".

Congratulations! You have successfully designed, simulated and tested a simple LED blink circuit with Proteus 8.1 Portable and Arduino Uno. You can save your project by clicking on the Save icon on the toolbar or going to File > Save Project.
