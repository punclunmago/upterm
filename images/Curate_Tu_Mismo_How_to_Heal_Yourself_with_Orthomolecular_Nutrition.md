One of the main principles of orthomolecular nutrition is that each person has a unique biochemical individuality and requires different amounts of nutrients for optimal health. Dr. Saul explains how to determine your optimal doses of vitamins and minerals by using simple tests, such as urine pH, blood sugar, and vitamin C saturation. He also provides guidelines on how to adjust your doses according to your age, weight, health status, and lifestyle factors.
 
Another important aspect of orthomolecular nutrition is the quality and safety of the supplements you use. Dr. Saul warns against the dangers of synthetic vitamins, additives, fillers, and contaminants that can be found in many commercial products. He recommends choosing natural, organic, and pure supplements that are made from food sources or bio-identical molecules. He also advises on how to store and take your supplements properly to avoid degradation and interactions.
 
Curate Tu Mismo is not only a book about orthomolecular nutrition, but also a book about self-empowerment and self-reliance. Dr. Saul encourages you to do your own research, experiment with your own body, and trust your own intuition. He also provides resources and references for further learning and support. He believes that you are the best doctor for yourself and that you can heal yourself with orthomolecular nutrition.
  
One of the most common questions that people have about orthomolecular nutrition is whether it is safe and effective. Dr. Saul answers this question by citing scientific studies and clinical trials that have shown the benefits of orthomolecular nutrition for various conditions, such as depression, schizophrenia, arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. He also debunks some of the myths and misconceptions that surround orthomolecular nutrition, such as the idea that it is too expensive, too complicated, or too risky.
 
Another common concern that people have about orthomolecular nutrition is how to integrate it with conventional medicine. Dr. Saul acknowledges that there are situations where conventional medicine is necessary and beneficial, such as in emergencies, infections, surgeries, and traumas. However, he also points out the limitations and drawbacks of conventional medicine, such as its focus on symptoms rather than causes, its reliance on drugs and surgery rather than prevention and nutrition, and its potential side effects and complications. He advises you to work with your doctor and inform him or her of your orthomolecular regimen, but also to be aware of your rights and options as a patient.
 
Curate Tu Mismo is a book that will inspire you to take control of your health and well-being with orthomolecular nutrition. It will teach you how to use natural substances to heal yourself from the inside out. It will also challenge you to question the status quo and seek the truth for yourself. Dr. Saul's message is clear: you can cure yourself with orthomolecular nutrition.
